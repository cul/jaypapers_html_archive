		  <td colspan="2" class="justified14px">Detailed explanation of relations with Spain, concerning both mission and monetary embarrassments. Money problems relieved temporarily in October by Franklin, hoped Spain would give some as well. The court promised someone to negotiate with Jay. Left hanging by Spanish court.  Reply from minister was complaint about Commodore Gillon of Frigate South Carolina at Corunna, whose ship was held in port. Correspondence with Colonel Searles, who had confidential papers from Mr. Adams in Holland. Believed that the Spanish minister could not regularize situation of American prizes or commerce without recognizing its independence, thus caught in a bind. Description of Captain Hill incident with the Cicero at Bilboa; believes he received unfair treatment from the Spanish. By November money problems again; no answer from Floridablanca or Franklin. Very frustrated with Del Campo∆s lack of instructions and prevarication. Believed Spanish would have been impressed with American successes in Virginia and capitulation at Yorktown, but not so. Neither answer to Mr. Harrison∆s note, nor reward money for Dover cutter given to its captors. Del Campo∆s constant illness. Met with French ambassador, who could not loan money as France preparing to send "great armaments" around the world. Because US not recognized, holders of bills could take action against Jay if bills protested. Observations on conduct of Spain as encouraging enemies, planting doubt among friends and lessening US desire to ally with Spain. France recommended caution and hope for Dutch loan. Letter from Franklin dissipated hope of aid; deterioration of monetary situation by early February. Silence of Floridablanca and increasing worry of Mr. Cabarrus about his money. Cabarrus offer to loan money for bills if Spain and France would guarantee loan. Begged French ambassador to speak to Spanish minister. Met Mr. Del Campo hoping to get money from Spain as so much already given by France. Mentioned Cabarrus offer and that Spain indebted to United States for recovery of West Florida and possession of Minorca. Cabarrus conference with Floridablanca about loan; king dissatisfied with American return of his good offices, in ships or flour, and still waiting to hear about building men of war in New England. Sees this as pretext of king to delay and not advance money. Met with French ambassador who would write again to Count de Vergennes but not hopeful about finding money for new bills. Sum only 20,000 pounds, surprised America∆s friends would let them lose credit over such a small amount. Spoke well of Marquis de Lafayette. Discussed situation in Holland, that Britain sent over Mr. Wentworth to negotiate separate peace. Told French that believed England most likely to recognize independence and that France did not want United States treated as independent, because would make United States less manageable. No reaction from French ambassador. Tried again with Floridablanca and Del Campo. Finally met with the minister, as bills due very soon. Spain would pay balance of $150,000 and no more but would meet with Cabarrus. Promised the French ambassador that promised talks (about the United States) would begin soon at Aranjuez. Assurance to Congress that Mr. Gardoqui would be sent to United States but delayed for variety of reasons. However, when Jay sent Cabarrus to the minister on March 11, informed that Jay had misunderstood and that Cabarrus should not be sent until the last extremity. Sends excerpt from the Madrid Gazette of an expedition of Spanish and Indians led by Eugenio Pierre against the British. Captured Post of St. Joseph, dispersed ammunition to Indians and claimed Illinois River for the Spanish. Goes back to business about bills coming due March 14, obtaining of delays on payment, and the change in Mr. Cabarrus∆ offer. After much back and forth with the French ambassador, the Chevalier de Bourgoigne, Mr. Del Campo and Floridablanca, forced to protest the bills. Both French and Spanish courts blamed for not helping United States for such a trifling sum. Told French ambassador that this might save us the Mississippi. Suspects Spain and France discussed United States; told by France that Spain wished to mediate between United States and England and limit independence. News that Parliament advised British king to stop offensive had great effect on Spanish court. Credit reestablished from Franklin∆s letter; refused to reconcile with Cabarrus and now employ Messrs Drouilhet. Invitation from minister due to recent news, but thinks not in our interest to make peace with Spain now, worthwhile to wait until we are stronger militarily. Bad state of Spanish finances; Spain wants to continue war and get Gibraltar.  France wants peace. Keep information Jay gets from French ambassador secret; De Marbois will fill in with great detail and information. Sweden leaning towards United States; Dutch will soon be our allies. In these circumstances, Spain should not expect Mississippi as price of acknowledgment. Courier de l∆Europe says English ministry have changed; unable to predict what changes will do. Serious attack on Gibraltar prepared, led by Duke de Crillon. Although Congress should be angry with Spanish court, should differentiate between the court and the people. Final matter concerns Êmistaken∆ invitation to Floridablanca∆s dinner as a private gentleman, approved by Spanish king. Doubtful that was mistake but still could not accept. Same reason does not go to Court, because would be received as ÊStranger of Distinction∆ rather than as minister from the United States.</td>
