		  <td colspan="2" class="justified14px">Hussey and Cumberland are in Spain.  June conferred with Floridablanca on June 2 and was told of the Cumberland mission. Spain could not compromise her good faith with the United States. Floridablanca accepted some new bills from Jay. Floridablanca told Carmichael that the only difficulty on the treaty was the navigation of the Mississippi. Cumberland arrived June 19 but his business is not openly known. Jay's next conference with Floridablanca was on July 5: the loss of Charleston and death of Miralles discussed. The bills also discussed. Everything postponed at this conference. Jay then wrote several notes on the bills, but no answer from Floridablanca who avoided Jay on the excuse of illness. Jay then had a conference with Montmorin who said he would speak to Floridablanca in Jay's behalf. Jay's next meeting with Montmorin was less cordial and he told Jay nothing of the letter he had received from America. Montmorin was not able to discuss the American business with Floridablanca and suggested to Jay that he write another letter requesting an audience. Jay said he had come to submit propositions, not supplications, and if no more headway was made on the treaty soon he would return to America. Montmorin asked Jay if America was satisfied with the conduct of France and Jay said as far as he knew but was not sure France had interceded with Spain in America's favor. Montmorin indicated he could not interfere unless to mediate a specific point. Jay finally consented to ask for a conference. Montmorin would not admit whether Gardoqui was in town. Jay met with Gardoqui and stated the American position on the Mississippi, loans, and timber. Jay stressed the western desire for the Mississippi at the next meeting and Gardoqui said only future generations would need it and they could settle the question for themselves. Gardoqui stressed that America should have asked France for aid, not Spain who could ill afford to give it. Jay replied that America should have been told this in the beginning. Gardoqui authorized Jay to accept the bills coming due however. Jay suspected that France had brought Spain into the war by supporting her claim to exclusive control of the Mississippi. Spain said accept no more bills. Jay asked Congress to suspend drawing on him further. Conference with Floridablanca, Sept. 23: Floridablanca said he was sorry Spain could accept no more bills, and Jay said he should have told him that in the beginning since America wanted a loan, not a donation. Jay said the French treaties should be made the basis of one with Spain. Floridablanca said Spain and France had different interests. Jay said he hoped they could form a treaty on the basis of the points agreed upon and negotiate the others. Spain wants to be the balance in the whole struggle. She could have paid our loan if she had wanted to. No nation, especially absolute monarchies, has a disinterested regard for us. We should be independent of all nations. No answer from Vergennes to my letter. Vergennes told Montmorin he doubted whether France could help.</td>
