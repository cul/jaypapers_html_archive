		  <td colspan="2" class="justified14px">Postpones full justification for signing provisional articles but sends own private remarks.  Doubts of Livingston enumerated: negotiators overly distrustful and the agreement signed without prior knowledge of French court. Reminder that the American commissioners insisted on four things from the British a priori that the French minister believed premature or excessive: treatment of America as independent nation, agreement to boundaries claimed by the United States, fishing rights, and no definite reinstatement of Tories. Evident that the French did not have American best interest in mind, whatever the minister∆s motives were. Reason for not communicating articles to French before signing: Lord Shelbourne feared would have to resign if no speedy conclusion to war and saw negotiations as furthering this end, thus the British made concessions would not have otherwise made. Also, the King agreed to ratify only what Mr. Oswald should sign and seal, not a verbal agreement. French, if given articles, would have postponed signing of agreement until French, Spanish and British treaty could be signed as well. Delay giving opening for British to consider themselves not bound by present articles and allowing France to pressure British to not concede to our demands. Too risky to not act as they did. Because signed in secret, avoided the necessity of offending the French in refusing to postpone signing. Although admits diverged from resolution of Congress, believes wording of resolution called for France to assist the United States in its aims, not discourage their completion. Confidence between allies already marred by French minister∆s lack of support for articles. French minister did not show the Americans his articles, so hardly surprising the Americans did the same. Considers Livingston∆s resignation due to his desire for happiness over wishes for the public good. Still many difficulties ahead, despite end of war and need for "advise and wisdom of our best men to manage". Has learned family needs nothing at present, but Livingston should talk to his brother Peter to learn of any needs unmet. Hopes to return next spring. Question of Tories. Opinion in Europe that ought to be generous towards them but they do not know "what inhuman barbarian wretches the greater part of them have been". Wants the United States to have consistent, just law in dealing with them. Ought to pardon all except the faithless and the cruel. Congratulations on children; would be godfather to second one. Little girl well and expecting new birth next month. Increase in family compared to situation of ancestors exiled from this country. Health improved.</td>
