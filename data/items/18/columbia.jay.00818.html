		  <td colspan="2" class="justified14px">Will express sentiments of Congress towards Jay∆s conduct and that of Spain. Congress had expectations of that country. Has heard that Spanish king is honest and dignified, and believes that the fate of the United States is important for a sovereign with control in the region. Assume the delaying tactics of his ministers do not originate with the king, that eventually his sentiments will influence his government. When Spain went to war with England, thought the Spanish would declare in favor of the United States. Disappointments aggravated by attempts of enemies of both countries to create discord between them, by alleging that Spain is waiting for a weakened United States in order to gain concessions and play a greater role in the aftermath of war. Congress needs to be able to justify to its constituents as great a concession as navigation on the Mississippi, and it has not been clear what Spain wants in return. A subsidy or loan is all that is wanted, especially as the United States is helping Spain by diverting British forces. France∆s understanding of this service demonstrated by aid given. Although Jay hinted that the Spanish postpone making a treaty until general peace, thereby ensuring more favorable terms, cannot believe they would do something so dishonorable. Apparently Count de Floridablanca wants to have the Gulf of Mexico; hard to reconcile it to demand Spanish made for Gibraltar. Believes as a maxim that a state cannot at the end of a war ask for more than restitution of prior claims or just compensation. If Spain thus has no right to Gibraltar, only just compensation, by what right then should they have the Gulf of Mexico or navigation of the Mississippi? The United States∆s claims are much better founded. Jay should not concede navigation of the Mississippi if Spain seeks advantage by postponing a treaty. General peace treaty will be conducted conjointly with the other American ministers. Should communicate freely with Spain and expect the same courtesy. Grateful to Spanish for rejecting separate offer of Great Britain. The United States prefers "general interest of the powers against Great Britain to any partial advantage that they might receive from a connection with them." Current news reports about Charleston premature. 400 men who embarked said to be detachment from New York troops. Great Britain appears not to continue offense southward since they only have 3000 men in Charleston and Savannah.</td>
