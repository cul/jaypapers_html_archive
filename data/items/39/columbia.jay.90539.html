		  <td colspan="2" class="justified14px">ALS.  Written by Troup as aide-de-camp to General Horatio Gates. In 1777 Addressed to Jay as Chief Justice of New York. Troup had been a law student under Jay. Provides a very blunt assessment of the situation in the Northern Department and gives his critical opinions on the now defunct Canadian expedition. References his last letter to Jay where he predicted the Canadian expedition would fail. He now says his prediction was correct, "for the Want of Men, and every necessary Article, has determined the General Officers to lay aside all thoughts of prosecuting it farther." Writes forcefully to Jay about how he never approved of the plan to begin with. Says there were too few troops and not enough intelligence to mount a proper attack. Says the attack's supporters claimed the Canadians would rush to the American side. He asks why anyone could have assumed such a turn of events and says the Canadians would have needed assurances of success before joining the rebel cause. Says the best possible outcome could have been their neutrality. Says Canadians have not sent any emissaries seeking to join the Americans and that Congress is relying on poor sources of information. Claims the intended expedition was a "political Monster" and that he "now enjoy[s] a secret pleasure in reflecting upon its Death." Predicts the British will focus on the Hudson River and Pennsylvania. Says if American armies get more reinforcements and check British advances, that an opportunity to capture Canada might develop. Writes to Jay as his patron since he is opposed to his own family. Claims Jay has helped him immensely. Wants to visit him in three weeks. Asks to be remembered to his wife and their common acquaintances.</td>
