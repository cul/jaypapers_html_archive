		  <td colspan="2" class="justified14px">Further thoughts on whether all war is forbidden by the Gospel. The Moral Law was given by God to all mankind; being founded on essential right, it can require no amendment. On the other hand, divine ordinances are founded on expediency and are under limited obligation. Our Savior assures us that He came not to destroy, but to fulfill the Law and the Prophets, that the Law and the Commandments are holy, just and good. Moses' law of retaliation was a legal penalty for certain offenses and not an encouragement of revenge. The Patriarchs sometimes violated Moral Law, for they were only men, but never did they do so by the authority of God, nor is any action according to Moral Law censured by the Gospel. Therefore, since divine ordinances authorized just war, this has not been abolished by the Gospel. The war between Abraham and David is an example of just war. Against the argument that Christ forbade all war, offers the instance at the end of the Last Supper, where the Lord says, "He that hath no sword, let him now sell his garment and buy one." Explains further instances involving swords before the Crucifixion. Jesus restrained his disciples from fighting for the reason that His kingdom was not of this world, and corporeal soldiers and weapons were inapplicable. However, He stated that if His kingdom had been of this world, then would His servants fight to protect Him. To John Jay the Gospel appears to consider the servants of Christ as bound to fight his spiritual enemies with spiritual weapons, and as subjects of a worldly state to be required to fights its worldly enemies. The wickedness inherited from mankind's first parents necessitated government by nations, each with authority to protect itself against domestic and foreign offenders. The Gospel enjoins us to obey our ruler as the minister of God, as he "beareth not the sword in vain." Also it must be considered reasonable that he use force to maintain the rights of his people against evildoers of other nations. Cannot think that the Gospel encourages us to abstain from resistance and expect miracles to deliver us. It is true that war and government are attended with evils, but they are means to avert greater ones. War kills, but so do peaceful occupations. The time will come when swords will be beaten into plowshares, but in the meanwhile our defenses must be maintained. Mankind must be prepared for universal peace before they can receive it.</td>
