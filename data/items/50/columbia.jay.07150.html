When he lived in England he formed societies in the major cities in which the government measures and the American revolution were freely discussed. The nobility as well as the people attended in great numbers, and finally the government ordered his arrest as a traitor employed by Congress. "Taking advantage of the impression made by the late riots in their favor and I believe secretly encouraged for the purpose of throwing an odieur on the measures of opposition and the spirit of association, an order of the privy council was issued to apprehend me as the Cataline of the conspiracy and the secret agent of Dr. Franklin to burn the city London." Concerning the origin of the riots, the trial of Lord George Gordon will throw light on the subject. It probably is another game of Lord Bute's to overthrow opposition, and that nobleman Gordon? was in on the secret. Many signed the Protestant Association because of fear of the indulgences given to the Catholics. Others signed as a matter of policy because they felt the pro-Papist acts and the Quebec Bill were designed to strengthen the court party. "Unless the system of affairs is speedily changed the whole of the business may be considered as the harbinger of another revolution." The people have begun suddenly to see the decay of trade and manufactures, the restitution of honors and offices, the loss of public liberty resulting from the increasing influence of the crown, and the impending national bankruptcy. The Bedford faction has joined the opposition. The most opulent families and popular Whigs, imitating the American example, have formed committees. A congress of deputies meets "under the very nose of parliament" and publishes anti-government resolutions. This prominent opposition, plus the democratic ascendency of the armed associations and the declarations of the Northern maritime powers, has alarmed the government. Suggestions for American success over England. Most important is to try to intercept her trade and capture her seamen. A secret correspondence ought to be established with friends in England. The opportunity for direct invasion has been lost. It might have been successful last summer, but now it would only arouse their martial spirit and unite all contending parties. However, a blow might be struck by expeditions from the Spanish ports before any intelligence of the plan could arrive in England.</td>
